    <h1>Qatar World Cup 2022:What to Expect</h1>
    <p>
      In December 2010, soccer’s governing body FIFA selected the tiny Gulf
      country to host the 22nd addition of the World Cup Finals. Qatar, which is
      slightly smaller than the US state Connecticut, was able to outbid the
      USA, South Korea, Australia and Japan in order to host the tournament
      finals—a result that was met with immediate speculation of bribery and
      vote rigging. I arrived in the oil-rich nation in November 2011, knowing
      very little about it other than the obvious of weather, wealth and
      religion. What I have found is a country aspiring to become a dominate
      figure in the world, yet a country that will need all 10 years to prepare
      for the World Cup—and maybe even more time.In December 2010, soccer’s

      country that will need all 10 years to prepare for the World Cup—and maybe
      even more time.Obviously, there are rumblings, to say the least, of
      corruption; however, I am not writing on the possibility of bribery or on
      those matters; that’s Declan Hill’s expertise. Rather, I simply want to
      present a country to those who haven’t experienced it or have little
      knowledge of the Gulf—except for what they see on the news. Qatar’s grand
      scheme is to rival their neighbor the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Over the
      past 10 years, Dubai in the UAE, has become a city of expatriates, foreign
      companies, and above all else, money. Doha is said to be 10 to 15 years
      behind Dubai, but as Doha has expanded outward and upward, Dubai has seen
      several problems develop.Ten years is a long time, unless you have to
      build a city almost from scratch which is what Qatar is nearly doing. The
      stadiums will be the last thing to be built, but the city will need major
      advancements in its public transportation system if it is to accommodate
      the World Cup. However, these things may need to be built much earlier
      than first thought. Qatar is bidding to hold the 2020 Summer Olympics,
      yet, they don’t want to hold the Summer Olympics in the summer. They have
      recently proposed an October date to hold the 2020 Olympic games. The
      country has earmarked $73 million for their Olympic bid and will find out
      in September 2013, according to Reuters, if they are the lucky hosts. If
      they are chosen to host the games, they will need to ramp up their
      construction even more as they prepare for two major tournaments within
      two years of each other.
